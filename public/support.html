  <h3>Common Support Questions</h3>
  <strong>I did not receive an email with a pin, where would I find it?</strong>
  <p>
    The email with your pin is sent to your BW email address that you entered when registering for Campus Plate. Please
    check the junk, clutter, or spam folder for this email.
  </p>
  <strong>My reservations that I had are now missing, why is that?</strong>
  <p>
    Your food reservation will expire after 30 minutes. If you do not claim the food during that time, the food becomes
    available for other members of the campus to retrieve.
