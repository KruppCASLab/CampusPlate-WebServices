  <h3>Contacting Support</h3>
  <p>
    Campus Plate was initially created in partnership with the Baldwin Wallace Brain Center and the Computer Science Department. If
    you require support, please contact the support center at your university where Campus Plate is deployed.

  <h3>Common Support Questions</h3>
  <strong>I did not receive an email with a pin, where would I find it?</strong>
  <p>
    The email with your pin is sent to the email address you used when registering for Campus Plate. Please
    check the junk, clutter, or spam folder for this email. You should use your university assigned email address.
  </p>
  <strong>My reservations that I had are now missing, why is that?</strong>
  <p>
    Your food reservation will expire after a set amount of time. If you do not claim the food during that time, the food becomes
    available for other members of the campus to retrieve.
  </p>
    <strong>I am not able to reserve food, why is that?</strong>
    <p>
        Not all food stops support the ability to reserve food, some food stops may only allow on-demand food retrieval.
